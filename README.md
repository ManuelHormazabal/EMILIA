Home of the EMILIA algorithm, a Time-Dependent Dynamic Identification Algorithm for civil engineering and seismic engineering purposes.

Project Main Objectives:
The main objective of this research is to design, test and validate a non-destructive dynamic identification
method based in a full non-parametric algorithm for the online assessment of large civil structures and
heritage buildings for seismic engineering purposes. This non-parametric algorithm will be capable of
processing linear (no damage) and nonlinear (with damage) data and the computed dynamic parameters
will be generated as time-dependent functions for the complete observation period. In addition, the
algorithm will properly deal with the main characteristics of data obtained from ambient structural
vibrations measurements: dynamic loads and non-linear structural behaviour, close spectral frequency
components, highly noise-contaminated data, and work in the low-frequency spectrum range.
The proposed method aims to be used as a health monitoring tool in tasks ranging from the simple OMA
for pre- and post-event analysis to the complex online assessment of the structural response during
seismic events and the rapid structural damage identification (detection, localization and quantification)
of ordinary and strategic structures and infrastructures, including heritage buildings.
Actual modal-based dynamic analysis methods can compute parameters like modal frequencies,
damping factors and mode shapes, but, as most of these methods work over parametric eigenvalue
decompositions, they are limited to work in the linear-elastic (no damage) strain range. Furthermore,
these methods cannot generate results as time-dependent functions, so several analyses must be
conducted to assess the evolution of dynamics parameters like natural frequency and mode shapes.
